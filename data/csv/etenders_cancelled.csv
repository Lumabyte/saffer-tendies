by the Dual Adjudicator Ms. Pumezile Makeba on the 26th of June 2022. A formal open tender was
issued for 22 calendar days and published through the Eskom Tender Bulletin and National
Treasury’s e-tendering portal on 27 June 2022 with the closing date of 19 July 2022.
A non-Compulsory clarification meeting was held with suppliers on 07 July 2022.During that meeting
the Quality Representative took the suppliers through the quality tender returnables. The suppliers
wanted to clarify if an ISO Certificate would be fine or if they should complete Section A and provide
all supporting documents. The Quality representative explained that ISO9001-2015, is fine but it must
be the correct ISO that was requested, suppliers to still complete and comply with Section B and the
rest of the documents. Clarity on the delivery was discussed and suppliers wanted to know if can
provide delivery for the required material. The response was that delivery would be carried out by
ERI.
The Technical representative also got the opportunity to take suppliers through the technical
returnables. The suppliers also wanted to know if they must deliver samples together with the tender
request, the response was that samples would be requested just before the granting the order. After
clarification meeting held on 07 July 2022 the technical representative sent Standard criteria to be added as part of the technical pack. It was then included as part of the tender returnables and posted
on the tender bulletins.
The technical evaluation team did evaluations on 10 August 2022, but the SME realized that technical
requirements issued with the tender were incomplete and the team could therefore not proceed with
evaluations as this posed a risk to Eskom. The SME was however not part of the SI Team that
prepared the initial technical requirements.
Based on the above reason, the tender should be cancelled due to Improper / unrealistic
specifications and functionality criteria in the enquiry document. The tender will be reissued"

Constitutional Court declared Preferential Procurement Regulations, 2017 valid in their entirety until 15 February 2023 or unless the new regulations are promulgated before that date. 
National Treasury advised all organs of state to decide whether to withdraw or not any quotations or tenders advertised before 30th of May 2022 in light of the above judgement and request new quotations that will be subjected to the 2017 Regulations. Therefore, PRSA decided to exercise this option and withdraw the above-mentioned RFQ.

REQUEST TO RE-ISSUE A TENDER

In accordance with the latest revision of Eskom’s Procurement and Supply Chain Management Procedure 32-1034, permission is requested to cancel and re-issue tender enquiry No WC1010TK for The Supply and Delivery of SF6 Optical Camera and Accessories for the Transmission Western Grid. 

2.	BACKGROUND 

The need for the Test equipment originates from Transmission. The SF6 Gas detection camera is to effectively ensure that SF6 gas leaks on installed equipment is correctly identified on Gas Insulated installations and to ensure that the repair method can be planned correctly. Furthermore, the identification of gas leaks while plant is in operation reduces down time and ensures that plant can be out of service for shorter periods of time.

For the Infra red camera it assist the operator to detect hot spots on terminal and bay equipment before and after operating takes place. This reduces the risk of plant failure.

The above purchase requisitions was sent to the Procurement Department via the SAP system. The procurement mechanism selected to enable this purchase is that of open tendering were an enquiry was issued on the 07 February 2022 closing on the 01 March 2022. No clarification meeting was held as this non-complex off the shelf equipment. 

Only one tenderer was received from the market, and was disqualified because of the pre-qualification criteria which request suppliers with a BBB-EE status level of contributor of EME & QSE 1 – 2. Based on this finding, Eskom is looking to open the enquiry to all suppliers without applying the pre-qualification criteria. 


RECOMMENDATION

It is recommended that approval be granted to cancel and re-issue enquiry No WC1010TK in order to conclude a contract for The Supply and Delivery of SF6 Optical Camera and Accessories for the Transmission Western Grid.

Dear Sir/ Madam


Kindly refer to the above subject.	


After careful deliberation, we regret to advise that Eskom Holdings SOC Limited would like to cancel the tender for the Maintenance and Repair Services for the currently installed System Operator Rear Projection (Mapboard) System on an As and When required basis for a period of 36 months- due to the following reason/s: 

•	Out of the two (2) tenders that were received, one tender was deemed technically non-compliant, and the second tenderer could not extend their tender validity which makes them non-responsive. 

Eskom would like to take the opportunity to thank you for participation in the above.

The need for the service remains and the tender will be issued again soon via the Formal Competitive Tendering Process. 


Yours Faithfully

d) there is a material irregularity in the tender process. 
Please see the technical department’s motivation for cancellation below:
There was a condition in the tender that bidders must submit their bank rating from their respective banks. Obtaining the bank ratings from various bidders was difficult and most banks was unable to provide us with the information to score this section of functionality. 
Most of the bidders completed the pricing schedule incorrectly and huge differences exists in the rates prices provided by the various bidders. 
This cancellation of this tender does not pose a risk as all the other projects for the current year already have OHS agents. The appointment of the roads project will be done in terms of a closed quotation process. 
The pricing and functionality will be re-visited, and a compulsory site meeting will be held to explain the functionality and completion of pricing schedule to ensure that all bidders understand how the schedule must be completed.
